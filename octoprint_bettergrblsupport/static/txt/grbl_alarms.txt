1 Hard limit triggered. Machine position is likely lost due to sudden and immediate halt. Re-homing is highly recommended.
2 G-code motion target exceeds machine travel. Machine position safely retained. Alarm may be unlocked.
3 Reset while in motion. Grbl cannot guarantee position. Lost steps are likely. Re-homing is highly recommended.
4 Probe fail. The probe is not in the expected initial state before starting probe cycle, where G38.2 and G38.3 is not triggered and G38.4 and G38.5 is triggered.
5 Probe fail. Probe did not contact the workpiece within the programmed travel for G38.2 and G38.4.
6 Homing fail. Reset during active homing cycle.
7 Homing fail. Safety door was opened during active homing cycle.
8 Homing fail. Cycle failed to clear limit switch when pulling off. Try increasing pull-off setting or check wiring.
9 Homing fail. Could not find limit switch within search distance. Defined as 1.5 * max_travel on search and 5 * pulloff on locate phases.
10 Homing fail. Second dual axis limit switch failed to trigger within configured search distance after first. Try increasing trigger fail distance or check wiring.
